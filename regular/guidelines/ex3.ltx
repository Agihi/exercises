Violation of following guidelines leads to a deduction of points in exercise 3.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Correct use of named sempahores (\texttt{sem\_open(3)},
  \texttt{sem\_close(3)} \texttt{sem\_unlink(3)}) and POSIX shared memory
  (\texttt{shm\_overview(7)}) for inter-process communication of separated
  programs (e.g., server and client).

  Use your matriculation number as prefix in the names of all resources.
\item ``Busy waiting'' is forbidden. (Busy waiting is the repeated check of a
  condition in a loop for synchronization purposes.)
\item Synchronization with \texttt{sleep} is forbidden.
\item You must implement signal handling (\texttt{SIGINT}, \texttt{SIGTERM})
  in all programs (e.g., both server and client).
  You must only use \emph{async-signal-safe} functions in your signal handlers.
\end{enumerate}
