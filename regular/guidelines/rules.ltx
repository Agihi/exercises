Compliance with these rules is essential to get any points for your
submission.\\
In other words, a violation of any of the following rules results in 0~points
for your submission.

\begin{enumerate}
\item The program must compile via
  \begin{lstlisting}
  $ gcc -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -D_DEFAULT_SOURCE -g -c filename.c
  \end{lstlisting}
  without \emph{errors}.
  These flags must be used in the Makefile, of course.
  The feature test macros must not be bypassed
  (i.e., by undefining these macros or adding some in the C source code).
\item The functionality of the program must conform to the assignment. The
  program shall operate according to the specification/assignment given the
  test cases in the respective assignment.
\end{enumerate}
